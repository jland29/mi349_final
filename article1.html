                <h2>Southwest Airlines to resume nonstop service between San Francisco and Chicago-Midway airports</h2>
                <p>News came out of Dallas, Texas - Southwest Airlines' headquarters - of the revival of nearly all of the routes that were originally axed due to the COVID-19 
                    pandemic that shut down the aviation industry back in 2020. Among the routes that were announced was nonstop service between Chicago-Midway (MDW) and San Francisco 
                    (SFO).
                </p>
                <p>This route was among the last to return, primarily due to Southwest's focus on leisure travel rather than business. Southwest already operates a hub across the 
                    bay in Oakland, as well as a focus city in San Jose. Combined, these two airports serve over 250 daily flights already - meaning that Southwest already has a 
                    significant presence in the Bay Area. This announcement shows Southwest's determination to keep competing against the two giants at SFO: United Airlines and 
                    Alaska Airlines - who recently just acquired Hawaiian Airlines in a $1.9 billion purchase. It is commonly referred to as the "Southwest Effect" when prices drop 
                    out of airports that Southwest serves, due to their lower pricing and two free checked bags per person.
                </p>
                <p>As Southwest brings back the remainder of its original route network, be on the lookout for further expansion from the airline. Southwest already has orders in the 
                    books for hundreds of new aircraft over the next handful of years, and has hinted at their intent to expand operations to Dallas-Fort Worth (DFW) Airport - a move 
                    made possible by the upcoming expiration of the Wright Amendment. Southwest will face steep competition, with American Airlines operating their largest hub out of 
                    DFW airport. However, Southwest has managed to find and maintain its market in similar situations, such as Miami, Chicago-O'Hare, and Houston-Bush airports.
